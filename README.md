# Franco-Arabic-Translator-
Franco Arabic (Arabic chat Alphabet) The Arab world has embraced a new writing style known as Franco-Arabic. It's not quite Arabic, and it's not quite English.  Instead, it's a system that uses the Latin alphabet and numbers to replace certain Arabic letters to write what Arabic words sound like phonetically.
